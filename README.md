# **Cycle 10 JavaScript Loops**

A lesson for Cycle 10 to go over JavaScript loops!


## **Run Locally**

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ALopez90/Cycle-10-JavaScript-Loops.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```


## **Lesson**

This lesson will cover the basic loops in JavaScript. Consider this an introduction to loops!

### **Objectives**

At the end of this lesson, you will...

1. Know how to write basic loops
2. Know the difference between the loops
3. Know how to control the loops

### **Introduction**

#### **What is a loop?**

A loop is a chunk of code that executes repeatedly when a condition is met. They're very useful when working with arrays and objects! It's a great way to make your code more efficient (if done correctly). 

#### **While Loops**

1. "While"
2. "Do... While"

#### **For Loops**

1. "For"
2. "For... In"
3. "For... Of"

### **Types Of Loops**

#### **Entry Controlled**

Requires for a condition to be met before moving inside the loop (e.x. "For" and "While")

#### **Exit Controlled**

Will execute the chunk of code once before checking for the condition (e.x. "Do... While")

### **Comparison**

#### **While Loops**

"While" loop evaluates the condition at the start of every iteration. Make sure that the condition eventually goes false!! You don't want this to loop forever.

"Do...While" loop will always be executed once even if the condition is false! This is due to the fact that the condition is evaluated at the end of the loop.

#### **For Loops**

The "For" loop is the most common loop that's used and is typically used to run the code a certain number of times.

The "For... In" loop is used to iterate through the properties of an object or elements of an arrays. DO NOT use this with an array if the index order is important!!

The "For... Of" loop allows for the iteration over arrays and the chunk of code is executed for every element inside the array. This DOES NOT work objects!
## **ðŸš€ About Me**
I graduated from i.c.stars |* Milwaukee summer of 2019, Cycle 3. I wore many hats as an intern -- project manager, technical analyst, and scrum master. Leading my team as the primary developer, we were selected as the winners of Cycle 3's sponsor project. It led to us presenting it in front of C-level executives at an event called iOpener at the end of that same year.

Continuing my passion in technology, I found myself working for MacGregor Partners. Working my way up, I'm now a Sr. Software Engineer for MacGregor Partners and considered the resident expert at ExtJS! Current techstack: ExtJS, ReactJS, AngularJS, MOCA, MS SQL, and Java.
